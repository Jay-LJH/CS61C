# CS61CPU

Look ma, I made a CPU! Here's what I did:

spend about 3 days to finish this project, compare to proj2, CS61cpu is definitly more challenge and interesting, the whole structure and guideline is clear, even a freshman can do it strictly follow the guidebook. When I encounter a bug at store and load part, I spend a whole day to find the problem, finally find it at control logic part, which I add a repeat pin in the logic. The pipeline part is also interesting. It is the first time I made a cpu and I think the project is worth trying.
