# CS61C

## self learning repo for CS61C sp22

### hi, this is my self learning repo for UC berekley cs61c. the great idea of computer structure. If you have any question or find any bug, please feel free to contact me.

### including answers for all labs and projects, but only the inclass student can reach homeworks

### I spent about 3 weeks on the class, I think it is similar to csapp and more suitable for new hand. proj2 and proj3 are the most challenge and interesting parts. You will learn how to write risc-v assemble instruction by hand and make a cpu using digital circuits. Besides with the labs and projects, you can learn something about cache, cpu pipeline, simd, virtual memory and so on.
