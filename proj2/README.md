# 61C Spring 2022 Project 2: CS61Classify

Spec: [https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj2/](https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj2/)

## cs61c self study progress

doing this part is not as challenge as I thought, due to I have accomplished 15213 months ago. I find that there are a lot of common between this two, 61c focus more on caller and callee save register while 15213 put less focus on it, the first time I call a function without saving ra, I encountered an infinite loop and cost some time to fix it.
It is interesting to cope with assembly code. Compare to lab2 and lab3 in 15213,it require less logical thought and have more detail in skeleton, though I success to make a hand write number classifier, I still a bit confuse in how the matrix work, maybe we can improve a little on this part.The whole task spends me two days to finish it.
